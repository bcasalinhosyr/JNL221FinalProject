                <p>They say three-pointers have defined the past decade of NBA basketball — is it actually true though?</p>
                
                <p>Since the rise of Steph Curry and the Warriors dynasty there’s been an arms race across the league to acquire shooting in an attempt to keep up. Just nine seasons ago in 2016, the 73-win Dubs shot a league-most 31.6 three-point attempts per game. A mark that would now rank just 29th in the association in 2024, where the league-most Boston Celtics shoot over 50 threes per night. The simple takeaway from this would be that teams have figured out shooting more threes results in more efficient offense – but is this actually true? Yes and no.</p>

                <p>A simple look at league averages over the past decade would indicate that, yes, shooting more threes results in more efficient offense. Last season teams scored a whopping 115 points per 100 possessions, the highest mark on record since the league started tallying the stat in 1973. That went hand in hand with the number of threes taken, a record most 37.7 per game for each team across the league.</p>

                <p>But this doesn’t hold true when we look at individual teams specifically. Because if this was the case that shooting more threes results in better offensive productivity, teams that shot the most threes would be the best teams in the league.</p>

                <p>Cleaning The Glass, a basketball analytics site that was founded by a former NBA executive Ben Falk, has a bunch of great statistics on their site that make it easy to dig into deeper, more advanced statistics where you can look into league trends and correlations such as this one. This data set in particular is nothing super complex, but it tells us what percentage of a team's shot attempts come from beyond the arch. It accounts for shots taken that a player was fouled on and counts it as a three, as well as filtering out other data like from what they call “garbage time” minutes. Which they define in their website is when a team is up 25 or more points at the start of the fourth quarter or later.</p>

                <iframe title="3-Point Volume Vs Win Percentage" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-SQw6L" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SQw6L/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="583" data-external="1"></iframe>

                <p>What we see in this data set is while yes, the reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics sit far and away as the team who gets up the highest percentage of three point shots. The next three highest teams: Chicago, Charlotte & Brooklyn, wouldn’t even make the postseason if the playoffs started today. As you go down the chart you clearly see there’s little if any correlation between three point volume and team success. The Oklahoma City Thunder who have taken the league by storm with their young nucleus the past two seasons are headlined by a throwback retro superstar in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Someone who is a midrange maestro, and only shoots a measly 34 percent from downtown. The definitive best player in the world, Nikola Jokic, captains a Denver offense that ranks dead last in three point volume. All this to say – it’s pretty random.</p>

                <p>I spoke with NBA media personality Ryan Hammer who’s accumulated hundreds of thousands of followers covering the league about this phenomenon and he told me he isn’t surprised what the data reflects. “Just looking at three point shot volume alone is leaving out a lot of nuance. You have to ask questions like – What are the quality of these shots? Who’s shooting these shots? Etc. He noted to me that the uptick in offensive efficiency over the past decade, while some of it can be credited to the three point revolution, also has plenty to do with the offensive archetypes of players in the present day. “Look at a team like the 2016 Thunder that made the WCF (Western Conference Finals) they started three non-shooters: Ibaka, Roberson, & Adams, that’s just not something we see anymore. The game is a lot more predicated on offensive versatility”</p>

                <p>Ok so if three point volume alone has no correlation with offensive success, what about shooting efficiency? Do the team’s with the highest three-point percentages yield the best offenses? Well, it’s more indicative of offensive success than strictly volume but still no. Three of the top 10 teams in three-point percentage hold a losing record. Just two of the 10 teams hoist a 60% or higher winning percentage (Cleveland & New York) while two of the bottom three teams (Orlando & Houston) own a 60% or higher winning percentage. </p>

                <p>What we find from all this data is that despite the obvious assumption that shooting more threes and doing so more efficiently would lead you to believe it translates into a more productive offense — it does not. Like Ryan alluded to, it’s more about the quality of these shots and who’s shooting them. Nuanced questions that can’t simply be answered through a number on a stat sheet.</p>

                <p>NOTE: Unfortunately Ben Falk, the founder of Cleaning The Glass, didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview.</p>
